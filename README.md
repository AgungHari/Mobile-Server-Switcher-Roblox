# Mobile Server Switcher Roblox

Switch servers with one touch. Too lazy to leave and select a server? Just run this script to automatically switch servers. Designed for mobile devices, I'm using an Apple-ware executor. This script has been tested on the game Fishing Simulator!

## How to use

just execute this line from your executor :
```bash
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgungHari/Mobile-Server-Switcher-Roblox/refs/heads/main/ver1.lua"))()
```
